Static and Dynamic Routes
    If you want to make any route then make files or foldes in pages 
    folder and name should start from small letter other wise it will 
    not work and give us error page not found and for dynamic route we 
    make file using square brackets [postId].js i.e: 1,2,3 etc and simililarly for folder
    [categoryName] i.e: electronics, clothes etc.
